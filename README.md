**Project Overview**

This repository contains the core codebase and scripts developed as part of my M.Sc. research at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, focusing on LLM-based metagenomic analysis. The project explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for analyzing DNA sequencing data at scale, enabling functional interpretation, classification, and visualization of metagenomic reads across diverse organisms.

**Main Components**

* Python scripts for read generation, annotation, classification, and statistical analysis
* Modeling pipelines that adapt LLM architectures (e.g., BERT-style models) to biological sequences
* Visualization tools for embeddings, confusion types (TP/FN), and model interpretability
* Custom datasets generated from NCBI RefSeq genomes, including bacterial and eukaryotic organisms

**Goals**

This project integrates techniques from AI, computational biology, and software engineering to enhance the interpretability and functional classification of metagenomic reads using modern deep learning methods.
